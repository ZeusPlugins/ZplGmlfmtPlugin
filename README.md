# Installation
- Install [Zeus Plugin Loader](https://github.com/ZeusPlugins/ZeusPluginLoader) if you haven't yet.
- Download the zip archive from Releases.
- Go to Preferences -> Plugins -> gml_fmt.
- Point the plugin at the gml_fmt you wish to use, by default I provide a gml_fmt build that works with 2.3 projects.
- Apply preferences and enjoy.

# How to use
You can run gml_fmt with a variety of ways:
- Press CTRL-SHIFT-Q. (cannot be rebound for now)
- A button in the menu bar.
- Turn on a checkbox in Preferences that will run gml_fmt on every project save.

# Known Issues
- Does not properly reload the project yet. (you'll get what I mean once you start using the plugin)
- GMS's Project File Watcher will have a seizure and throw it's hands up in the air.
